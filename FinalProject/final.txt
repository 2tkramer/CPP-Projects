TITLE: Taylor Kramer, section B, "Soul Cereal".

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: This program is focused on the health aspect of cereal. 
                     Everyone has some sort of dietary needs and wants and you can just type in your 
                     preferences and the program will return a list of cereals that best suits your needs.
                     
PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION: There will be promps clearly stated telling the user what needs to be typed.
                       As for a future editor of this program, the only things that might get changed are 
                       the number of data entries which would require no changes to the program, only the csv file. 
                       If they wanted to add a variable, this would require adding it to the struct as well as the functions using this variable.
                       
TESTS: I tested each filtering feature in program adding up to nine different tests to ensure that my program filtered the data properly
       
REFLECTIONS: i learned that you can run into unsusual problems. For example, when trying to sort the data into a specific data type from the csv file, 
            it would not import properly because the proper delimiter did not exist in a particular spot. I found that after hours of trying to debug 
            one little thing that these are sorts of issues that can be caught from running many tests as you are writing code and not after. step by 
            step is more thorough and less bug prone.
